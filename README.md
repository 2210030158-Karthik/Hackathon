My Thinking : 

Lets list what problems students face when learning : 
    -> Lack of stimulus
    -> Procrastination
    -> Get easily distracted 

ok from this i can conculude that for students to learn we need to combine learning with interactive ideas such as flash cards and pop quizes,
stuff too keep them occupied. Lets see what we can do.


Ok so now the solution to these problems is to make an app that does not allow you to switch tabs. (LOCKDOWN MODE)
-> It helps students learn using flashcards, popquizes , and based on learning adujusts the scale.







DEVELOPED app is a personalized education platform that adapts learning content
to each student’s familiarity, pace, and preferences using AI.

OOh and i forgot to mention the most important feature -> on the top right of the website when we click on the gear wheel we can set the "TONE" for the teacher AI. It will adjust the level of complexity of word choice, Adjust to the uptake of the child (ex. a child is a slow paced learner we can set it to that), and help explain with examples , theory or balance them both based on the prefrences of the user. THIS CHANGES IN REALTIME. Please try and check too.
